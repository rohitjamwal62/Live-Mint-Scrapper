Scrap news contents using scrapy
1. First, make sure Python is installed on your local system. If you don't have Python installed on your system, then you can visit this link and download the python. ====https://www.python.org/downloads/====
2. Install the visual code on your system. ====https://code.visualstudio.com/download====
3. Open the terminal on your system or the command prompt and visit the project folder where the project file is stored.
4. Next, install the requirements.txt file, but make sure that you are already in the folder where you want to run this file. I'm sharing the command below: -------
====pip install -r requirements.txt====
5. Next, run this command.
scrapy crawl livemint
